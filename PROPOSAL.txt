HYPOTHESIS
----------

Research Question:
    Can a transistor-level register cell effectively enforce read access 
    control based on privilege levels, preventing unauthorized access to 
    sensitive state even when an adversary controls the read signal?

We hypothesize that a custom CMOS register cell with dual read ports—one 
unrestricted (secure) and one gated by a privilege signal (public)—can 
successfully implement hardware-enforced context isolation. Specifically, when 
the secure mode signal is deasserted, the public read port will return a 
masked value (logic 0) regardless of the stored data, while the secure port 
maintains access to the true value.


WHY THIS QUESTION IS INTERESTING
---------------------------------

This research topic is directly inspired by the 2025 ZION paper 
(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133121), which outlines a confidential 
VM for commodity RISC-V hardware. This project aims to build upon the findings 
of the original ZION paper.

The ZION paper addresses a critical vulnerability in virtualized systems: 
hypervisors (which schedule VMs) typically have full access to VM register 
state, creating a security risk if the hypervisor is compromised. ZION's 
architectural solution keeps the authoritative vCPU state isolated from 
untrusted software. Our project explores whether this protection model can be 
implemented at the most fundamental hardware level—the storage cell itself.


APPROACH
--------

Circuit Design:
    We will design a 1-bit secure register cell in Cadence Virtuoso:
    
    * Storage core: Cross-coupled inverter pair for static data retention
    
    * Write path: Transmission gate controlled by write enable (WE) signal
    
    * Secure read port (QSEC): Direct buffered access to stored value—always 
      reflects true data
    
    * Public read port (QPUB): Conditional access via transmission gate enabled 
      by secure mode (SEC) signal, with NMOS clamp to ground when SEC=0

Experiments:
    We will run transient simulations testing multiple scenarios:
    
    (1) Write '1' with SEC=1 → verify both ports read correctly
    
    (2) Assert SEC=0 → confirm QSEC maintains '1' while QPUB outputs '0'
    
    (3) Write '0' and repeat privilege transitions
    
    (4) Corner case analysis with voltage/temperature variations to verify 
        masking reliability

Setup:
    Single-bit cell schematic in Virtuoso using the course-provided PDK. 
    Testbench will toggle D (data), WE (write enable), and SEC (secure mode) 
    inputs while monitoring internal node X, QSEC, and QPUB outputs. Transistor 
    sizing will follow standard digital cell guidelines (PMOS 2× NMOS width in 
    inverters, matched transmission gate widths).

Analysis:
    We will generate waveform plots showing the key security property: when SEC 
    transitions from 1→0, QPUB immediately masks the data while QSEC remains 
    unchanged.
    
    Success metrics include:
    
    (a) QPUB correctly outputs 0 when SEC=0 regardless of stored value
    
    (b) Write operations succeed in both modes
    
    (c) No data leakage through capacitive coupling or charge sharing
    
    We will extend the design to a 4-bit register bank to demonstrate 
    scalability and calculate area/power overhead compared to a standard 
    register cell.
